All this data collection has been analyzed to compare and visually quantify the trip's interesting patterns of behaviour and its impact between the two cyclists. | Self-tracking metrics has been analyzed and visualized on [this](www.thebiketripproject.com) website after the end of the trip. There also has been a live-map of our exact location that was updated once a day. Some of the metrics were: coordinates, speed, elevation, cycling distance, walking distance, active Heartrate, resting Heartrate, sleeping time, calories burnt, calories consumed, water consumption, weather.|\n"
