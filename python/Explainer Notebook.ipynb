    "| Starting point on July 5th from Tallin, Estonia and finish in Thessaloniki, Greece. The planned daily schedule was to cycle ceaselessly day by day, with fixed breaks of 2 hour lunch stops and sleeping for the night right after sunset. | During the trip, quantified-self tracker sensors have been used to measure various metrics. All this data collection has been analyzed to compare and visually quantify the trip's interesting patterns of behaviour and its impact between the two cyclists. | Self-tracking metrics has been analyzed and visualized on [this](www.thebiketripproject.com) website after the end of the trip. There also has been a live-map of our exact location that was updated once a day. Some of the metrics were: coordinates, speed, elevation, cycling distance, walking distance, active Heartrate, resting Heartrate, sleeping time, calories burnt, calories consumed, water consumption, weather.|\n"

    "> Our **moms and beloved ones**: They usually talk to us once a day on the phone and they ask for coordinates in order to look for us if something goes wrong ;-).
